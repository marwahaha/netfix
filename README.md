# netfix

A lightweight, cross-paltform HTTP library implementation written in C++

# contributions guidelines
* We are doing art, we write beautiful code
* Cross-platform, remember ?
* Must be lightweight
* K.I.S.S (Keep it Simple, Stupid)

# TODO
* Distinguish dynamically HTTP from HTTPS (only SSL currently, so divide the appropriate parts into functions) (and conquer)
* User-agent, HTTP version...etc -> give more control to the user
* Extend the current code to make an Object Oriented version of it (currently everything is static)
